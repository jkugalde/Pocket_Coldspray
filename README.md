# README

This is the repository for my thesis project. It is a G-Code generator for a coldspray process implemented on a Pocket NC, using micro nozzles.

## Current state

Basic code for linear trajectory with oblique reinforcement. Code separated in parameters files and main. Still not integrated with the full process.
